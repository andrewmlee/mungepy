# MungePy

MungePy is a set of tools used for wrangling and cleaning messy data. I have created these functions in order to cut down on time spent replacing values, cleaning data, and other common tasks used when preparing data. 

## Getting Started

No need to install this library, just download the files into your working directory. You will however need to make sure that you have **pandas** installed.
